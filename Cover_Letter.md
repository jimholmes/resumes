Hi!

I'm Jim Holmes and I'm looking for a rewarding job with a software organization looking to improve the value it delivers to its customers, regardless whether those "customers" are internal or external. I'm particularly interested in working with software delivery teams, or in a role in product evangelism.

I have several decades' experience working in various corners of Information Technology. I've filled roles from small computer repairman at a branch office of a global oil engineering company to Director of Engineering of a team building cutting-edge test automation tools. I've been a product evangelist traveling around the world spreading the word about a cutting-edge test automation tool. I've also served as an Executive Consultant embedded in software delivery organizations at a Fortune Ten company. 

I've helped organizations transform their software delivery cultures and processes, bringing in Lean and Agile concepts and helping build learning and quality cultures. I've worked directly in delivery, support, and marketing roles both as a line worker and leader.

I excel at working in sales, pre-sales, and ongoing support/collaboration roles with customers, and I have a proven ability to help resolve broken or damaged business relationships. I have an internationally acknowledged skill for content creation, instruction, and community building.

My focus for the last ten to 15 years has been on software quality, particularly around exploratory testing and test automation. Although I am not currently a software engineer by trade, I've spent time cutting code for .NET, SharePoint, and Java projects. I continue to work closely with software engineers as part of my regular efforts.

I've set up and managed delivery pipelines on a number of different technology stacks. I'm also intimately familiar with good design principles and the use of tools like static code analysis (locally and on build servers) to help guide and improve development practices. I'm very effective at working in pairs and mobs to help guide and mentor, and I'm very open kimono about things I don't know.

I have a deep understanding and years of practical experience with Lean and Agile philosophies. I've helped guide a number of organizations to better delivery practices. I thrive when an organization has an honest commitment to improving, even if they don't know how to.

I'm looking for part- or full-time work from my home in Ashland, Oregon, USA. I'm open to travel up to 25% now until spring of 2018 at which point I'm available to travel up to 50%. I have years of successful accomplishments both as a team member and leader of remote teams. Much of that experience involved working with teams scattered across the US, Europe, eastern Europe, and India.

I'd love to speak with you about how I might help bring value to problems your organization might be facing. I look forward to hearing from you.
